        <h3>Recipe page</h3>
        <p>
            Recipe title: Each recipe should begin with an attractive and descriptive title. The title will be clear and concise, but will also capture the reader's attention.
            Recipe image: An attractive image of the finished recipe can make recipes more appealing to visitors. Images should be of high quality and clearly show the end result of the recipe. I consider including several images that show the steps of the recipe as well as the final presentation.
            Ingredient list: Each recipe should include a complete list of ingredients. Ingredients should be clearly listed and quantities should be accurate. It is also helpful to include any ingredient substitutions for those with dietary restrictions. You may consider including links to specific products or brands that you recommend.

            Preparation and cooking time: It is important to include the total preparation and cooking time for each recipe. This helps visitors plan their time in the kitchen. I can also include the resting or marinating time, if necessary. 
            Recipe yield: I will indicate how many servings each recipe yields. This is especially useful for those who are planning a meal for a specific number of people. I can also include the serving size, if relevant.
            Nutritional information: If possible, I will include nutritional information for each recipe. This can be especially useful for those who are following a specific diet or who are trying to track their calorie intake. Nutritional information can include calories, grams of protein, grams of carbohydrates, grams of fat, etc.
            Tips and tricks: I will include any tips or tricks that can help visitors be successful in making the recipe. This could include tips on cooking techniques, cooking utensil recommendations, or suggestions for recipe variations. I may also include notes on how to store or freeze the recipe, if relevant.
            Social sharing buttons: I will include social sharing buttons so that visitors can easily share the website with their friends and family. This can help increase the visibility of my site and attract new visitors.
