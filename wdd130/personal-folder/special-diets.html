                    <h3>HOW TO MAKE SEITAN CASSEROLE WITH MUSHROOMS</h3>
                    <p>1- Chop the onion into very fine cubes along with the zucchini and make a small saut√© over low heat to poach.</p>
                    <p>2- Once the onion and zucchini are poached, add the chopped mushrooms to the sauce and keep them over low heat for about three minutes.</p>
                    <p>3- Without turning off the heat, add a liter and a half of water together with salt, oregano, thyme and dried garlic. Let it simmer until 50% of the water is reduced.</p>
                    <p>4- On the other hand, in a frying pan with a little garlic, lightly fry the seitan fillets until the surface is lightly browned.</p>
                    <p>5- Add the seitan fillets to the mushroom stew and leave it all together over low heat for ten minutes, so that some sauce remains in the pan at the end of cooking.</p>

                    <h3>Suggestion</h3>
                    <p>- If you do not want to abuse the common wheat, remember that there is also spelt seitan, a more digestive and nutritious variety.</p>
