    <h2>Dilan Conde</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm 18 years old from Lima Peru, this is my first semester of byu, and I'm a software developer student.</p>
    <p>I like many sports but specially soccer and basketball because i play them every week.</p>
    <p>I was baptized 4 years ago with my parents and sister, and one year later we were sealed as an eternal family in the temple in Lima Peru, and now my sister and I are preparing to serve in a full time mission.</p> 
    <p>The courses I am taking in my first semester are great as well as this one, because I am learning many new things that will help me to be successful academically and also in the future.</p>
