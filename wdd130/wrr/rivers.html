                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>The Salmon River, located deep within the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return Nature Preserve, is a place that has captivated many. Those who live near the river, known locally as the River of No Return, often find themselves so enamored with its wild beauty that they decide to stay forever. The surrounding landscape is home to herds of elk and deer, and it is not uncommon to spot bears and bighorn sheep. In addition, majestic ponderosa pines line the river, providing shade on the sandy beaches of the campgrounds and protection from sun or rain.</p>

                <p class="two">The Salmon River is one of the longest rivers in the United States that has not been interrupted by dams. Its flow varies with the seasons, being higher, faster and cooler in early summer, and lower, slower and warmer in late summer. Although the river offers exciting rapids throughout the summer, families with children often prefer the calmer, warmer waters of late summer for swimming.</p>
